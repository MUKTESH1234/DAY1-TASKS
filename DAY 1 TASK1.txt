                                                   Difference between HTTP1 & HTTP2


                        HTTP1:   1. It loads a single request for every TCP connection.
                                 2. It is less faster and less reliable than HTTP2.
                                 3. It has poor response time.
                                 4. HTTP 1 sends message in plain text format only.

                        HTTP2:   1. HTTP2 avoids network delay by using its latest technology i.e        
                                    Multiplexing the network scheme.
                                 2. It is more faster and reliable than HTTP1.
                                 3. It has faster response time.
                                 4. HTTP2 encodes the text message into binary data and arranges them carefully.
